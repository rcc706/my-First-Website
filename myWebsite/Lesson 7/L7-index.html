         <p>This is my website for the ed2go course: Creating Web Pages</p>
         <p>
             This is a <strong>practice paragraph</strong> that contains multiple sentences. 
             A longer paragraph like this will allow me to see <em>word wrap</em> 
             in action in my Web browser. Word wrap means that the text will wrap 
             to fit the width of the browser window. So long as the browser window 
             is a reasonable width, text will not shoot off past the right edge of 
             the window forcing me to scroll to the right to see it. The wrapping 
             occurs at spaces between words at the ends of lines. That prevents 
             any individual word from being split across two lines.
